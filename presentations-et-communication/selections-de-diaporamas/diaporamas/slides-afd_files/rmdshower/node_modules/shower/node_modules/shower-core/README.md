# Core for Shower

Core for the [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower/) presentation engine. Doesnâ€™t include themes. [See it in action](http://shwr.me). Follow [@shower\_me](https://twitter.com/shower\_me) for support and updates, [file an issue](https://github.com/shower/shower/issues/new) if you have any.

## Usage

Get the [Shower template](https://github.com/shower/shower/) where core is already included. Download the template [archive](http://shwr.me/shower.zip) or install the package:

```
npm install shower
```

You can also install core as a separate package:

```
npm install shower-core
```

The same packages available in [bower](http://bower.io).
